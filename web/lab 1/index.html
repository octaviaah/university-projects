                <h1>My favorite team</h1>
                <p>My favorite team is Bayern Munich. They are a German team based in Munich, Germany, founded on
                    <b>February 27th, 1900</b> by 11 football players, led by Franz John. It is the most successful professional
                    club in German football history, having won a record 31 national titles, 20 national cups, along with
                    numerous European honours. Bayern had its golden period in the mid-1970s
                    when, under the leadership of players like captain Franz Beckenbauer, Gerd Muller or Sepp Maier, it
                    won the European Cup 3 consecutive times(in 1974, 1975, and 1976). Since then, the club's success
                    continued and it is very present today. Bayern plays its home matches at Allianz Arena,
                    a stadium with a capacity of 75 000 seats. The team colors are red and white, and the team badge
                    shows the white and blue flag of Bavaria.</p>

        <h3>Rivalries</h3>
        <p>Throughout the years, it formed some sporting rivalries with clubs from Germany and Europe. The main local
            rival is 1860 Munich, who was more successful club in the 1950s and was controversially picked for the
            initial Bundesliga season in 1963. More recently, it enjoys rivalries with Bayer Leverkusen,
            Borussia Moenchengladbach and Borussia Dortmund, against which it contested important matches like German
            Cup finals or the Champions League final in 2013. The European rivals are Real Madrid, A.C Milan and
            Manchester United due to many classic wins, draws and losses. The matchup between Bayern and Real Madrid has
            historically been played most often in European competitions with 24 matches. Despite the number of duels
            between them, they have never met in the final of an European competition.</p>

        <p>Aside from the matches played during the pandemic, the stadium is always sold-out when Bayern play. As any
            other team, there are dedicated ultra groups that follow the team everywhere it plays. They sing chants and
            bring red and white flags to the stadium to show their support. For important matches, like those in Champions
            League, the ultras create big presentations called "tifos", which involve the whole stadium.</p>
        <p>Below is a video of such tifo:</p>
