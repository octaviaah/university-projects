* [Advanced methods of programming](https://github.com/octaviaah/university-projects/tree/main/map/Toy%20Language%20Interpretor)
	* Toy Language Interpretor - a Java application where structure and syntax related to a "toy language" is implemented
* [Computer networks](https://github.com/octaviaah/university-projects/tree/main/retele) - tcp and udp servers in C and Python and Packet tracer projects
* [Computer systems architecture](https://github.com/octaviaah/university-projects/tree/main/asc) - some lab work and practice problems in Assembly
* [Databases](https://github.com/octaviaah/university-projects/tree/main/db) - a database that manages countries + queries related to actions on the database
* [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://github.com/octaviaah/university-projects/tree/main/sda) - data structures implemented in given containers
* [Dynamic Systems](https://github.com/octaviaah/university-projects/tree/main/sdin) - labs solved in Maple
* [Graphs](https://github.com/octaviaah/university-projects/tree/main/graphs/Graph%20Manager) 
	* Graph Manager - a Python application where a series of algorithms or options can be applied to graphs inputed in text files
* [Functional and logical programming](https://github.com/octaviaah/university-projects/tree/main/plf) - all the labs in Common Lisp and SWI Prolog
* [Fundamentals of programming](https://github.com/octaviaah/university-projects/tree/main/fp/Book%20Store)

	* Issue Tracker - a C++ application which tracks issues - users can add issues, solve them etc.
	* Q&A site - a simple C++ application where users can add questions and answer to multiple questions
* [Operating systems](https://github.com/octaviaah/university-projects/tree/main/os) - a lot of C and bash problems related to processes, threads and bash related functionalities (note: most are in .txt files because they were taken from Ubuntu server)
* [Probability and statistics](https://github.com/octaviaah/university-projects/tree/main/ps) - all the labs in Octave
* [Software Engineering](https://github.com/Gherghel-Vlad/ISS-Academic-Web-App)
