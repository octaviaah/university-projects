# university-projects
All projects I have made during university:
<<<<<<< HEAD
*Advanced methods of programming
	*Toy Language Interpretor - a Java application where structure and syntax related to a "toy language" is implemented
*Computer networks - tcp and udp servers in C and Python and Packet tracer projects
*Computer systems architecture - some lab work and practice problems in Assembly
*Databases - a database that manages countries + queries related to actions on the database
*Data Structures and Algorithms - data structures implemented in given containers
*Dynamic Systems - labs solved in Maple
*Graphs 
	*Graph Manager - a Python application where a series of algorithms or options can be applied to graphs inputed in text files
*Functional and logical programming - all the labs in Common Lisp and SWI Prolog
*Fundamentals of programming
	*Book Store: a Python application which manages a book store - books can be added, rented, returned etc.
*Object-oriented programming
	*Event Manager - a C++ application which manages an event database - events can be added or modified by administrators, users can sign up for events etc.
	*Issue Tracker - a C++ application which tracks issues - users can add issues, solve them etc.
	*Q&A site - a simple C++ application where users can add questions and answer to multiple questions
*Operating systems: a lot of C and bash problems related to processes, threads and bash related functionalities (note: most are in .txt files because they were taken from Ubuntu server)
*Probability and statistics - all the labs in Octave
*Web programming - the first labs(the rest are coming soon) in HTML, CSS and JavaScript
