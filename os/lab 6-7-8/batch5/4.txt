Find recursively in a given directory all the symbolic links, and report those that point to files/directories that no longer exist. Use operator -L to test if a path is a symbolic link, and operator -e to test if it exists (will return false if the target to which the link points does not exist)

#!/bin/bash

read dir
if [ ! -d $dir ]; then
        echo not a dir >&2
        exit 1
fi
for link in `find -L $dir`; do
        if [ ! -e $link ]
        then
                echo $link
        fi
done
