Find recursively in a directory, all the files with the extension ".log" and sort their lines (replace the original file with the sorted content).

#!/bin/bash

read dir
if [ ! -d $dir ];then
        echo not a dir >&2
        exit 1
fi
for file in `find $dir -type f -name "*.log"`;do
        sort $file > file.txt
        rm $file
        mv file.txt $file
done
