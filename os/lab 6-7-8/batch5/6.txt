Find recursively in a directory, all the files that have write permissions for everyone. Display their names, and the permissions before and after removing the write permission for everybody. You will need to use chmod's symbolic permissions mode, instead of the octal mode we have used in class. The the chmod manual for details.

#!/bin/bash

read dir
if [ ! -d $dir ]; then
        echo not a dir >&2
        exit 1
fi
for file in `find $dir`; do
        if echo `ls -l $file` | egrep -q '^-[-rwx]{7}w[-rwx] '; then
                file_perm=`ls -l $file | awk '{print $1, $9}'`
                echo $file_perm
                chmod o-w $file
                file_perm_w=`ls -l $file | awk '{print $1, $9}'`
                echo $file_perm_w
        fi
done
